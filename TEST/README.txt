Introduction
////////////

This game is still being developed each day and is still even in a pre alpha
state. The idea is to create a strategy RPG with randomly generated dungeons
as well as a main set story.

BASIC CONCEPT
You have 5 characters (warrior, highwayman, ranger, mage, acolyte)
Each character has 4 abilities which have descriptions when mouse'd over

BASIC TURN
A unit has movement and an action point. The blue squares will use the unit's
movement points and the yellow area is "dash" squares that will use your action
point to gain more movement points.

examples: you can move in the blue area then attack or just move into the 
yellow area.

OBJECTIVE
The objective of the game is currently to kill all enemies however a win
condition is not yet programmed in.
